# 32. Coffee Smoke

### Notes

#### Noise Textures

While choosing a noise texture, keep in mind the following 3 rules:

- Enough variations so that we don’t see the pattern repeating too much.
- Big enough so that it’s precise enough. Yet, you don’t need a huge resolution since the pixels are going to be interpolated.
- A repeating pattern (or “tilling”) so that we can put the image side by side with itself and not see the separation.
